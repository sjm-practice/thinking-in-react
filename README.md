# Thinking in React
This is a code-along exercise, following the [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) tutorial.

## Notes
* I deviated from the example, by using the container pattern
    * this led to probably a little sloppy coding, in terms of passing props around sloppily -if so, this is due to inexperinece with this pattern (but working on it)
